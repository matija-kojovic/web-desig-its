    <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
    <p>
        <b><i>Nikola Tesla</i></b>  was a <i>Serbian-American</i> inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (<b><abbr  title="">AC</abbr></b>) electricity supply system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented 
        <b>AC induction motor and transformer</b> were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. His work in the formative years of electric-power development was involved in a corporate <b>alternating current/direct current</b> <q>War of Currents</q> as well as various patent battles. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1891.

        Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.In his lab, he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.

        Tesla was renowned for his achievements and showmanship, eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal <q><b>mad scientist</b></q>. His patents earned him a considerable amount of money, much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees of success.He lived most of his life in a series of New York hotels through his retirement. Tesla died on 7 January 1943 in New York City. His work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

        The <b>tesla</b> (symbol <abbr title="">T</abbr>) is a unit of measurement of the strength of a magnetic field. It is a derived unit of the International System of Units, the modern form of the metric system. One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre (<b>Wb/m<sup>2</sup></b>). The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named[1] in honour of Nikola Tesla.

    <p>
        After leaving Edison's company, Tesla partnered with two businessmen in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light Manufacturing. The company installed electrical arc light-based illumination systems designed by Tesla. It also designed dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.

        The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment. They were more interested in developing an electrical utility than inventing new systems. They eventually forced Tesla out, leaving him penniless. He even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount the winter of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery.

        In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's patents and other ideas, they agreed to back him financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.
